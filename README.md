# Standard_algorithms
Standard algorithm of DSA

Welcome to our Hacktoberfest 2023 repository! We're excited to have you join us on this open-source adventure focused on optimizing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) solutions, specifically targeting LeetCode questions. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to sharpen your algorithmic skills or a newcomer eager to learn, this is the perfect place for you.

üöÄ What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest is an annual event celebrating open source software and encouraging contributions to the community. By participating in this event, you not only learn and grow as a developer but also earn some cool swag along the way.

üí° Project Goals:
Our primary goal is to create a comprehensive collection of well-optimized solutions for a wide range of LeetCode questions. We believe that the best way to learn and improve is by working together. Here's what you can expect from this repository:

DSA Mastery: Sharpen your DSA skills by solving LeetCode problems and optimizing existing solutions. We encourage contributors to analyze and improve code efficiency, readability, and performance.

Community Collaboration: Join forces with developers from around the world. Exchange ideas, discuss strategies, and learn from each other's insights. Together, we'll create a valuable resource for the programming community.

Hacktoberfest Celebration: Contribute to this project during Hacktoberfest, and your efforts will count towards earning those coveted limited-edition Hacktoberfest t-shirts and swag.

üìÅ Project Structure:
Our repository is organized into different directories, each representing a LeetCode question or a category of problems. You can find well-documented problem statements, existing solutions, and guidelines for optimization in each directory.

ü§ù How to Contribute:
Getting started is easy! Follow these steps:

Fork this repository to your GitHub account.

Choose a LeetCode problem you'd like to optimize or solve from scratch.

Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., "optimize-binary-search") and make your changes.

Ensure your code is well-documented and follows best coding practices.

Submit a Pull Request (PR) with a clear explanation of your changes.

Our maintainers will review your PR, offer feedback, and merge it if it meets our quality standards.

Celebrate your contribution to open source and Hacktoberfest!

üëè Let's make Hacktoberfest 2023 a memorable and productive experience. Join us in our mission to optimize DSA solutions and enhance our understanding of algorithms. Together, we can create a valuable resource for developers worldwide.

Happy coding, and may your algorithms run efficiently!
